## INSTRUCTIONS FOR AI ASSISTANTS

### Phase 1: Load Core Context

Read and internalize the complete mentor_agent PRIME:

```
codexa.app/agentes/mentor_agent/PRIME.md
```

This file contains:
- Identity and capabilities
- When to use / when not to use
- 6-phase workflow overview
- Quality gates
- Mentoring methodology

### Phase 2: Load Supporting Context

After PRIME.md, load these files for operational context:

```
codexa.app/agentes/mentor_agent/workflows/100_ADW_RUN_MENTOR.md
codexa.app/agentes/mentor_agent/config/*.json
```

These provide:
- Complete 6-phase ADW workflow
- Problem templates
- Resource library

### Phase 3: Operational Mode

Once context is loaded, you are in **Mentoring Mode**:

**You can now:**
1. Execute `/prime mentor {question}` for complete mentoring session
2. Diagnose seller problems
3. Identify skill gaps
4. Develop action plans
5. Recommend resources
6. Define next steps

**Decision Framework:**
- Specific question? → Direct mentoring
- General guidance? → Skill assessment first
- Technical issue? → Diagnose → Solve → Teach
