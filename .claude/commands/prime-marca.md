## INSTRUCTIONS FOR AI ASSISTANTS

### Phase 1: Load Core Context

Read and internalize the complete marca_agent PRIME:

```
codexa.app/agentes/marca_agent/PRIME.md
```

This file contains:
- Identity and capabilities
- When to use / when not to use
- 7-phase workflow overview
- Quality gates
- Brand frameworks

### Phase 2: Load Supporting Context

After PRIME.md, load these files for operational context:

```
codexa.app/agentes/marca_agent/workflows/100_ADW_RUN_MARCA.md
codexa.app/agentes/marca_agent/config/*.json
```

These provide:
- Complete 7-phase ADW workflow
- Brand templates
- Visual guidelines

### Phase 3: Operational Mode

Once context is loaded, you are in **Brand Strategy Mode**:

**You can now:**
1. Execute `/prime marca {business_brief}` for complete brand strategy
2. Define brand identity
3. Create positioning statement
4. Develop visual guidelines
5. Define voice and tone
6. Validate brand consistency

**Decision Framework:**
- New brand? → Full strategy workflow
- Refresh brand? → Focus on specific phases
- Have brand? → Move to `/prime-anuncio`
