## 🚨 COMMON ERRORS (And How to Avoid)

### Error 1: Vague Promise
**Problem**: "Transforme sua vida com este curso"
**Solution**: "Aprenda 5 estratégias práticas para [specific outcome] em [timeframe]"

### Error 2: Long Videos (>40min)
**Problem**: Completion rate <15%
**Solution**: Break into 8-12min lessons, add exercises between

### Error 3: No Onboarding (Aula 0)
**Problem**: 30-40% students don't know how to navigate
**Solution**: Mandatory 5-10min welcome video explaining platform + support

### Error 4: Skipping Compra-Teste
**Problem**: Students can't access Club, broken links
**Solution**: ALWAYS run full test purchase before public launch

### Error 5: Hidden Support Channel
**Problem**: Students frustrated, no way to get help
**Solution**: Display support email in Club header, welcome email, and FAQ

### Error 6: Single Traffic Source
**Problem**: Algorithm change kills 100% of sales
**Solution**: Diversify: 2-3 channels (organic, paid, affiliates)

### Error 7: Ignoring Gotejamento
**Problem**: Students binge-watch, request refund "too easy"
**Solution**: Weekly drip release, completion gates, exercises

### Error 8: No Analytics Tracking
**Problem**: Can't optimize, no idea what's working
**Solution**: Add FB Pixel, Google Analytics, UTM parameters on day 1

### Error 9: Auto-Approve Affiliates
**Problem**: Spam affiliates, brand damage, refunds
**Solution**: Manual approval, strict guidelines, audit regularly

### Error 10: Weak Checkout Copy
**Problem**: High traffic, low conversion
**Solution**: Add social proof, guarantee, FAQs, urgency (if honest)
