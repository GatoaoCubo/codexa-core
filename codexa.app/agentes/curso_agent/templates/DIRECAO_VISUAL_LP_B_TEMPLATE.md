## AUDIO DIRECTION

### Music Arc

**Track Type**: Electronic/Tech Startup Energy

**Structure**:
```
00:00-01:30  TENSION BUILD    → Dark synth, rising tension, sparse
01:30-03:00  PROBLEM PEAK     → Add percussion, anxiety-inducing
03:00-04:30  RELIEF DROP      → Bass drops, rhythm stabilizes
04:30-06:00  SUCCESS BUILD    → Melody enters, uplifting progression
06:00-07:00  CLIMAX           → Full arrangement, triumphant
```

**Reference Tracks**:
- Urgency: Hans Zimmer "Time" (percussion only)
- Tech: Daft Punk "Derezzed" (electronic tension)
- Success: Avicii "Levels" (uplifting build)

### Sound Effects (SFX)

| Timecode | SFX | Purpose |
|----------|-----|---------|
| 00:05 | Crash/boom | Hook attention grab |
| 00:45 | Clock ticking (accelerating) | Time pressure |

| 06:50 | Button click | Final CTA |

### Strategic Silence

- **02:28-02:32**: 4-second silence before glitch transition (dramatic pause)
- **06:58-07:00**: Music fades out, leaving only final CTA text on screen

### Voiceover Direction

**Tone**: Energetic, urgent, conversational (not aggressive)

**Pacing**:
- Hook: Fast, urgent (180 WPM)
- Dor: Empathetic, slower (150 WPM)

## VERSION COMPARISON

### Video A vs Video B

| Element | Video A | Video B (This File) |
|---------|---------|---------------------|
| **Pace** | Contemplative | Urgent |
| **Cuts** | 80-100 total | 150-200 total |
| **Color** | Blue → Gold | Red → Green → Gold |
| **Music** | Ambient build | Electronic tension |
| **Camera** | Smooth, steady | Dynamic, handheld |
| **Audience** | Deep learners | Action-takers |
| **Emotion** | Calm confidence | Excited urgency |

**When to use**:
- **Video A**: Blog posts, email sequences, long-form content
- **Video B**: Social ads, retargeting, high-energy campaigns

---

## FINAL NOTES

This visual direction prioritizes **ENERGY** and **URGENCY** over calm education. Every cut, color, and camera movement should reinforce the message: "This problem is urgent, the solution is clear, act now."

The contrast between the chaotic RED/GRAY sections and the successful GREEN/GOLD sections should be visceral - viewers should *feel* the relief of the solution.

The {{EASTER_EGG_NAME}} MODE easter egg serves as a brief pattern interrupt, rewarding attentive viewers with a moment of delight amidst the intensity.

**Key Principle**: If a shot feels too calm, it's wrong for Video B. Push energy higher.
