## 🎨 COLOR PSYCHOLOGY & SELECTION

### Primary Color Selection

**Process**:
1. **Start with archetype** → Colors that match personality
2. **Consider category** → What do competitors use? (differentiate or align?)
3. **Test emotional response** → What feeling does color evoke?
4. **Check marketplace** → Does it stand out in search results?

### Brazilian E-Commerce Imagery Best Practices

**Do**:
- ✅ Use diverse models (Brazil is multicultural)
- ✅ Show scale (add size reference)
- ✅ Natural lighting (warm, tropical feel)
- ✅ Colorful backgrounds (not always white)
- ✅ Real-life settings (relatable contexts)

**Don't**:
- ❌ Stock photos (obviously staged/generic)
- ❌ Cold/clinical lighting (feels distant)
- ❌ Only one skin tone (not representative)
- ❌ Overly edited (unrealistic)
- ❌ US/European only contexts (not relatable)

---

## 🎨 MARKETPLACE COLOR OPTIMIZATION

### Thumbnail Visibility Test

**Colors that stand out on white** (ML, Shopee, Magalu):
- ✅ Red, Blue, Orange, Purple, Green
- ⚠️ Yellow (needs dark border)
- ❌ White, Cream, Light Gray (disappears)

**Test**: View thumbnail at 100x100px → Can you spot it instantly?

---

### Marketplace-Specific Considerations

**Mercado Livre**:
- Yellow branding → Avoid pure yellow products (blends)
- Use high contrast for visibility
- Blue competitors dominate → Differentiate with red/orange

**Shopee**:
- Orange branding → Avoid pure orange
- Flash sale = red/pink → Use complementary colors
- High competition → Bold colors perform better

**Magazine Luiza**:
- Blue branding → Blue products blend well
- Clean white backgrounds preferred
- Professional photography over creative
