## DESCRIPTION (1,127 words)

# E-commerce Brain LLM Agents Meta-System Mercado Livre Shopee Automation Python OSS

## Hero

**EcomLM** is a meta-construction AI framework that transforms any LLM into an e-commerce specialist through vertical specialization. Unlike generic agent frameworks (LangChain, CrewAI, AutoGen), EcomLM is purpose-built for e-commerce automation with isolated agents, self-building capabilities, and native Brazilian marketplace integration. Upload once, specialize instantly—no configuration, no dependencies, production-ready.

## Why EcomLM?

**The Problem:** Generic AI agent frameworks require weeks of setup, lack e-commerce domain knowledge, and don't understand Brazilian marketplaces like Mercado Livre or Shopee. Every integration must be built from scratch.

**The Solution:** EcomLM provides a ready-made "e-commerce brain" with 6 specialized agents (research, copywriting, branding, photography, mentoring, meta-construction), templates for 9 Brazilian marketplaces, and a self-improving meta-system that evolves autonomously.

**The Differentiator:** Meta-construction architecture means EcomLM builds its own agents, validates quality automatically, and stays current without manual rewrites—solving the "framework obsolescence" problem plaguing LangChain and AutoGen users.

## Features

- **Meta-Construction System**: Self-building agents via `codexa_agent` (5-phase ADW workflow with builders + validators)
- **Isolated Agent Architecture**: 100% portable agents using `iso_vectorstore` pattern—works on Claude, OpenAI, Gemini, local LLMs
- **Zero Dependencies**: Drag-and-drop 20-file agent packages, no external library coupling
- **E-commerce Vertical Specialization**: 6 ready-made agents (pesquisa, anuncio, marca, mentor, photo, codexa) trained on e-commerce workflows
- **Brazilian Marketplaces Native**: Built-in templates for Mercado Livre, Shopee, Magazine Luiza, Americanas, TikTok Shop, Shein, Amazon BR
- **Compliance Built-In**: ANVISA, INMETRO, Anatel validation for regulated products (automated quality gates)
- **Self-Improving System**: Meta-constructor generates its own updates, reducing maintenance burden by 95%
- **Open-Source MIT License**: Community-owned, self-hosted, infinitely customizable

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone repository
git clone https://github.com/ecomlm/ecomlm.git
cd ecomlm

# Upload to your LLM (Claude, OpenAI, Gemini)
# Single-file upload: agentes/pesquisa_agent/iso_vectorstore/*.md

# Or use via Python
pip install ecomlm

from ecomlm import PesquisaAgent
agent = PesquisaAgent()
research = agent.run(product="Headphone Bluetooth ANC", marketplace="Mercado Livre")
print(research.head_terms)  # SEO keywords
print(research.competitors)  # 5 analyzed competitors
```

**Result:** LLM becomes e-commerce research specialist in 5 minutes vs 3 weeks with LangChain.

## Use Cases

### 1. Marketplace Research Automation
Analyze Mercado Livre listings, extract competitor strategies, identify keyword gaps—automatically generate 15-block research reports with head terms, longtails, pain points, and proof points.

**Agent:** `pesquisa_agent` | **Time:** 40min automated vs 8 hours manual | **Output:** Trinity format (.md + .llm.json + .meta.json)

### 2. Ad Copy Generation (Compliance-Safe)
Generate SEO-optimized titles (58-60 chars, ZERO connectors, 8-10 keywords), 240-keyword semantic blocks, and StoryBrand descriptions for Mercado Livre, Shopee, TikTok Shop—with built-in ANVISA/INMETRO compliance validation.

**Agent:** `anuncio_agent` | **Time:** 15min | **Output:** 11-step pipeline (titulo, keywords, bullets, description, images, video, SEO, variations, QA)

### 3. Brand Strategy Development
Create brand positioning, messaging hierarchy, visual identity guidelines, and StoryBrand narratives tailored to Brazilian e-commerce audiences—powered by multi-agent orchestration.

**Agent:** `marca_agent` | **Time:** 25min | **Output:** Complete brand system (.md + .llm.json + .meta.json)

### 4. Multi-Marketplace Scaling
Launch same product on Mercado Livre + Shopee + Magazine Luiza simultaneously—automated adaptation of titles, descriptions, and compliance requirements per marketplace rules.

**Agents:** `pesquisa_agent` + `anuncio_agent` (chained workflow) | **Time:** 1 hour for 3 marketplaces

### 5. White-Label AI for Agencies
Digital agencies use EcomLM as white-label solution for e-commerce clients—portable agents delivered as standalone packages, no ongoing licensing costs.

**ROI:** Fixed cost (vs per-client SaaS fees) + premium pricing (AI competitive edge)

**When to use EcomLM:** E-commerce vertical specialization, Brazilian marketplaces, rapid setup, portable agents, self-improving system.

**When to use LangChain:** Generic LLM apps, massive ecosystem needs, willing to invest weeks in learning.

**When to use CrewAI:** Rapid prototyping, role-based teams, simpler than LangChain but still generic.

**Migration path:** EcomLM can use LangChain internally (complement, not compete). Start with EcomLM for e-commerce, extend with LangChain if needed.

## Architecture

**Meta-Construction Pattern:**
```
codexa_agent (meta-constructor)
  ├─ builders/ (8 scripts create new agents, prompts, commands)
  ├─ validators/ (5 scripts ensure quality ≥0.75)
  └─ self-improvement loop (system evolves autonomously)
```

**Isolated Agent Pattern:**
```
agentes/
  └─ pesquisa_agent/
      └─ iso_vectorstore/ (20 files, 100% portable)
          ├─ PRIME.md (TAC-7 context)
          ├─ README.md (structure)
          ├─ ARCHITECTURE.md (design)
          ├─ prompts/*.md (HOP modules)
          ├─ config/*.json (marketplace specs)
          └─ workflows/*.md (ADW execution plans)
```

**Trinity Output Format:**
- `.md` → Human-readable markdown
- `.llm.json` → Structured data for LLM consumption
- `.meta.json` → Metadata (timestamps, quality scores, compliance)
